Face identification in images using python.

### Code Requirements
- Opencv(`pip install opencv-python`)

### What steps you have to follow??
- Download my Repository 
- Open face_recog.py file in any IDLE  (like spyder,jupyternotebook etc)
- Run that file
- Once it run a GUI will open ,in that GUI 1st we have to train our module bu uploading image
- Note that uploading image have our name 
- After done training close that window 
- Click on Scan Image button and select that image which you want scan and identify faces
- Once Image Scan completed this program will tell you which person found in scan image in voice formate and will display image having face identification

### Notes
- It will require high processing power(I have 8 GB RAM & 2 GB GC)
- If you think it will recognise person just like humans,than leave it ,its not possible.
- Noisy image can reduce your accuracy so quality of images matter.
